        Sure, I used to work there. Go straight for about a mile, then turn left
        at the light. The mall will be on the right.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do you know the address?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, the address is 541 Main street.</p>
      <p><strong>Can you write it down for me please?</strong></p>
      <p>No problem.</p>
      <p><strong>Is it faster if I take Highland avenue?</strong></p>
      <p>No, that way is longer. There are more stop lights on that street.</p>
      <p><strong>I think you&rsquo;re right. Thank you.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>My laptop, do you see it?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, your laptop is on the chair.</p>
      <p><strong>Where&rsquo;s my book?</strong></p>
      <p>Which one?</p>
      <p><strong>The dictionary.</strong></p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s under the table.</p>
      <p><strong>Where&rsquo;s my pencil?</strong></p>
      <p>There&rsquo;s a pencil in front of the lamp.</p>
      <p><strong>That&rsquo;s not a pencil. That&rsquo;s a pen.</strong></p>
      <p>Oh, sorry. There is a pencil behind the cup.</p>
      <p><strong>How about my backpack? Do you know where that is?</strong></p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s in between the wall and the bed.</p>
      <p><strong>Where are my shoes?</strong></p>
      <p>They&rsquo;re on the left side of the TV.</p>
      <p><strong>I don&rsquo;t see them.</strong></p>
      <p>Sorry, I made a mistake. They&rsquo;re on the right side of the TV.</p>
      <p><strong>Thanks.</strong></p>
      <p>Oh, and here are your glasses. They were next to your cell phone.</p>

        Coach. OK, let me check availability. I&rsquo;m sorry. Tickets for that

      </p>
      <p><strong>How about the one after that?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Let me see. Yes, that one still has seats available. Would you like me
        to reserve a seat for you?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Yes, please.</strong></p>
      <p>That&rsquo;ll be 120 dollars.</p>
      <p><strong>Thank you, here&rsquo;s your change.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Which cup?</strong></p>
      <p>The red one.</p>
      <p><strong>Put it on top of the table.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>This looks like a nice restaurant.</strong></p>
      <p>Yeah, it is. I come here all the time.</p>
      <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s sit over there.</strong></p>
      <p>OK.</p>
      <p><strong>Can you pass me a menu please.</strong></p>
      <p>Sure. What are you going to have to drink?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>I&rsquo;m going to have a glass of beer. How about you?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>I think I&rsquo;ll have a glass of wine.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you want to order an appetizer first?</strong></p>
      <p>Not really, maybe we can just order some bread.</p>
      <p><strong>What are you going to have to eat?</strong></p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m not sure. I haven&rsquo;t decided yet. Can you recommend
        something?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Sure, I&rsquo;ve had the steak and the lobster before. They&rsquo;re
          both very good.</strong

      <p>I think I&rsquo;ll have the lobster. What are you going to have?</p>
      <p>
        <strong

      </p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m gonna go to the bathroom. When the waitress comes back, will
        you order for me?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sure. No problem.</strong></p>

      <p>
        <strong

      <p>
        <strong
          >Actually, most of them are dirty. I haven&rsquo;t done laundry in a

        <strong

      </p>
      <p>OK, but please hurry. I think the restaurant is closing soon.</p>

      <h3><strong>Lesson 37: FINDING A CONVENIENCE STORE</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Pam, where&rsquo;s the closest ATM?</strong></p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s not that far. Do you see that Yellow building over there?
      </p>
      <p><strong>The big one or the small one?</strong></p>
      <p>The big one.</p>
      <p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s right next to it, on the right.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Do you know if there&rsquo;s a convenience store around here?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one around here. The closest one is on
        3rd street, but that&rsquo;s probably closed now.
      </p>
      <p><strong>I really need to get some things before I leave.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Well, you could go down to 22nd street. There are lot of stores down
        there that are open 24 hours a day.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Can I take the subway to get there?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Yes, but that&rsquo;ll probably take about half an hour. You should just
        take a cab.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Won&rsquo;t that be expensive?</strong></p>
      <p>No, from here I think it&rsquo;s only about 5 dollars.</p>

      <p>Canada is north of here.</p>
      <p><strong>Can you show me on the map?</strong></p>
      <p>Sure. Look here. Canada is north of the United States.</p>
      <p><strong>Oh, I see. Where&rsquo;s Mexico?</strong></p>
      <p>Mexico is south of the United States.</p>

      <p>Connecticut is east of New York.</p>
      <p><strong>What state is west of Pennsylvania?</strong></p>
      <p>Ohio.</p>
      <p><strong>OK, Where&rsquo;s Los Angeles?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Los Angeles is in California. It&rsquo;s southeast of San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Where&rsquo;s Boston.</strong></p>
      <p>Boston is in the northeast part of the country.</p>

      <p>Yes, I ate at the hotel with my son and my husband.</p>
      <p><strong>Oh, they have good food there. What did you have?</strong></p>
      <p>I had some cereal, fried eggs, and orange juice.</p>
      <p><strong>How was it?</strong></p>
      <p>
        The food didn&rsquo;t taste very good, and actually, I don&rsquo;t feel
        very well now.
      </p>
      <p><strong>That&rsquo;s too bad. Do you want to take a break?</strong></p>
      <p>
        No, I&rsquo;m going to go back to the hotel at lunchtime to lie down.
      </p>

      <p>Will you come and pick me up?</p>
      <p><strong>What time?</strong></p>
      <p>
        I think we should get there early because they might be sold out. Is
        5:00 PM OK?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Yes, that&rsquo;ll be fine. I&rsquo;ll meet you at your house at 5:00

        <strong

          popcorn and hot dogs at the theater if you want.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t like the popcorn they have there. I think they put too
        much salt on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >OK then, I&rsquo;ll pick you up a little earlier and we can go to the

      </p>
      <p>Yes, I like that place.</p>

      <p><strong>Tomato and rice. Have you had that before?</strong></p>
      <p>No. This is my first time. How does it taste?</p>
      <p><strong>It&rsquo;s good, try it. What do you think?</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Judy, your husband has a really nice car.</strong></p>
      <p>Thanks. It&rsquo;s a lot better than mine, and it&rsquo;s new.</p>
      <p><strong>Where are you going?</strong></p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re going to visit my sister in the city.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >I didn&rsquo;t know your sister lives in the city, when did she move
          there?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from
        the public library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >I see. It&rsquo;s almost 5:00 PM now, don&rsquo;t you think there
          will be a lot of traffic?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, we&rsquo;re not driving. We&rsquo;re going to take the subway. The
        subway only takes about 20 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel
          uncomfortable taking the subway.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>I take the subway to work every day, so I&rsquo;m used to it now.</p>
      <p><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t your mother live in the city?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, she&rsquo;s lived there for about ten years.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper
          then.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I know what you mean. It&rsquo;s hard to find anything that&rsquo;s
        reasonable now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Have a good time. Next time you&rsquo;re free, give me a call and
          we&rsquo;ll go play poker.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>See you later.</p>

      <h3><strong>Lesson 44: LOOKING AT VACATION PICTURES</strong></h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Jim, I heard you took a trip to San Diego. Is that right?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, I just got back this morning.</p>
      <p><strong>That sounds really nice. What did you do there?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Well, we were only there for three days, so we didn&rsquo;t do too much.
        We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times. At night we walked
        around the city with some friends.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Did you take any pictures?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them?</p>
      <p><strong>Sure, I love looking at photos.</strong></p>
      <p>
        This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter
        Emily standing next to my wife.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Your daughter looks like her mother.</strong></p>
      <p>I know, they look very similar.</p>
      <p><strong>Where was this picture taken?</strong></p>
      <p>That was taken at the train station before we left.</p>
      <p><strong>Did you have time to go to the zoo?</strong></p>
      <p>No, not this time. We went there last time.</p>
      <p><strong>It looks like you all had a nice time.</strong></p>
      <p>Yeah, it was a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3><strong>Lesson 45: ORDERING FLOWERS</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Good afternoon, how may I help you?</strong></p>
      <p>Hi, I&rsquo;d like to order some flowers.</p>
      <p><strong>Who are they for?</strong></p>
      <p>They&rsquo;re for my Wife. Her name is Samantha.</p>
      <p><strong>What kind of flowers would you like?</strong></p>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know too much about flowers. Can you
        recommend something?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What&rsquo;s the reason you are sending her flowers?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Today&rsquo;s her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her
        flowers.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do you know what kind of flowers she likes?</strong></p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;m not sure. I know I should know that, but I can&rsquo;t
        remember right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Well, they&rsquo;re for your wife, so I think you should give her
          roses.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Roses will be fine.</p>
      <p><strong>What color?</strong></p>
      <p>I think red would be nice.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Can you deliver them please?</p>
      <p><strong>What&rsquo;s the address?</strong></p>
      <p>241 Main street.</p>
      <p><strong>Alright, they&rsquo;ll be there within 2 hours.</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Hello?</strong></p>
      <p>Hi, is Heather there, please?</p>
      <p><strong>Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.</strong></p>
      <p>Is this 617-228-2289?</p>

      <p>Heather Johnson.</p>
      <p>

          >Oh, I thought you said Laura. Sorry about that. This is the right
          number, but Heather&rsquo;s not here right now.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Do you know where she went?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >She went to the store to buy some groceries. Would you like to leave
          a message?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Yes, would you please tell her Eric Martin called?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Hi Eric, this is her roommate Kathy. I met you a couple of months ago
          at the Christmas party.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Oh, yes. How are you?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Good. Heather will be back in about 20 minutes. I&rsquo;ll tell her
          you called.</strong

      <h3><strong>Lesson 47: TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Hello?</strong></p>
      <p>Hi Tina, It&rsquo;s Joe.</p>
      <p><strong>Hi Joe.</strong></p>
      <p>How&rsquo;s the weather there today?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >It&rsquo;s really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed
          early.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>What&rsquo;s the temperature?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >It&rsquo;s 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it&rsquo;s
          probably going to snow tomorrow.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>I really don&rsquo;t like the winter. I wish it were summer.</p>
      <p><strong>Me too. How&rsquo;s the weather where you are?</strong></p>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s not too bad, but it&rsquo;s pretty cold here too. It was
        about 45 today and it rained this afternoon. I heard it&rsquo;s going to
        be a little warmer tomorrow.

      <h3><strong>Lesson 48: MAKING PLANS</strong></h3>
      <p>
        <strong
          >It&rsquo;s almost Christmas. What are you doing this weekend?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Nothing special, just working. Why do you ask?</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Well, I still haven&rsquo;t finished my Christmas shopping. Do you
          want to go shopping with me this weekend?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I&rsquo;d like to, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can. Work has been really
        busy lately. Why don&rsquo;t we go on Friday instead?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Friday&rsquo;s not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and
          I have to work.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, then let&rsquo;s try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go
        by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine.</strong></p>
      <p>What&rsquo;s your number?</p>

      <p>Lesson 49: MEETING A FRIEND</p>
      <p><strong>Hello?</strong></p>
      <p>Hi Vicky.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you there yet?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>
        <strong

          late.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        That&rsquo;s no problem. I just wanted to tell you I&rsquo;m inside.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Where are you?</strong></p>
      <p>On the second floor.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first
          floor?</strong

      </p>
      <p>Come upstairs.</p>
      <p><strong>What?</strong></p>
      <p>Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, come to the second floor.</p>
      <p><strong>Oh, OK. What are you doing there?</strong></p>
      <p>Just looking at some books on how to learn English.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you want to get something to eat later?</strong></p>
      <p>No, I&rsquo;m still full from dinner.</p>
      <p><strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t know for sure. When you get here we&rsquo;ll talk about
        it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>OK, see you soon.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Craig, what do you do for work?</strong></p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m still a student.</p>
      <p><strong>What school do you go to?</strong></p>
      <p>Boston University.</p>
      <p><strong>That&rsquo;s a good school. What do you study?</strong></p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m studying English, math, and history. My major is English.</p>
      <p><strong>How long have you been studying English?</strong></p>
      <p>More than six years.</p>
      <p><strong>That&rsquo;s a long time.</strong></p>
      <p>Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school.</p>
      <p><strong>No wonder your English is so good.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Actually, it&rsquo;s not that good. I can read but I can&rsquo;t speak
        very well. I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of chances to practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I see. Talking with other people is very important.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, but I still don&rsquo;t have many friends here yet.</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >I&rsquo;m having a party tonight at my apartment. You should
          come.</strong
